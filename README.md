# General Information

In order to run the calculations you have to execute all cells in the `Analyss-Tool-442.ipynb` notebook. 

We suggest to create a virtual environment for this:

```bash
python -m venv ./.venv
```

After this, you have to activate the virtual environment and install the required packages:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you can run the Jupyter notebook (make sure to have the virtual environment activated and the `ipykernel` selected  when running the notebook).
